# React.js client container (TypeScript)

## Troubleshooting

* **Prettier** If Prettier stops working and doesn't format code on Save, do this: https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/issues/1257#issuecomment-593119501

* **React errors** If you experience some weired React errors, most likely it is because your filename ends with `.ts`. Rename it to `.tsx` and errors will be gone.
